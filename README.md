# Buisness blog card - Challenge 28

This is one of the many challenges I'm doing to improve my frontend development skills from [devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/challenge/28)

## Technologies used:
- HTML
- Tailwind (as a CSS replacment)
- Vite (building the project and better development experience)
- VS Code (text editor)
- Github pages (deploy)

## What I learned:
- Since this is one of the first times I've used tailwind, I got to learn it's basics
- I used the tailwind documentation alot
- It was much better for me to google for a CSS solution then a tailwind solution when I needed help; I think the tailwind solutions more often than not, led me astray

## Challenges and things to learn:
1. I wasn't able to get tailwind to work properly with vite
- I have it installed twice (one from npm and the other as cdn), I kept the the npm version since it alowed vs-code tailwind extention to work properly
- I think I deleted the nessary files from the vite template to get it to work, I'll have to tackle this issue in the next project

## Things I want to check out later
- I need to find a better way to deploy to github pages, since the manual copy of build files into the gh-pages branch seems sketchy

## Other notes
build with vite: `vite build --base="./"`
- This links all static resources to the current directory of the built html
